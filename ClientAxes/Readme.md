# ClientAxes
A quick and easy way to log client requests during conversation.

## Summary
The database is built from your trade history and the information submitted from the front end. The database then contains all the information of what your clients have traded on and what they wish to trade on. You can then compare them to your daily axes and, using machine learning, have a probabilistic idea of what the client will trade with you. As the database grows, the algorithm will continue to be more accurate lending to more successful trades given any high probability.
